                <p style="color: #fff; max-width: 80%; padding-left: 5px;">
                    To the right is the list of homebrewed Ability Scores. Each AS relies directly on base dnd stats and works as an extension to the base D&D Ability Scores. The Ability Scores are as followed : <br><br>
                    MTA (Metaphysics) = Wisdom<br><br>
                    KNO (Knowledge) = Intelligence<br><br>
                    INS (Inspiration) = Charisma<br><br>
                    ADA (Adaptability) = Constitution <br><br>
                    FLU (Fluidity) = Dexterity <br><br>
                    EXP (Exponentialism) = Strength<br><br>
                    Calculating the homebrewed Ability Scores is slightly different then base D&D. There is no rolling for stats involved, Instead, the base number for each AS is based on the modifier of the related D&D AS’s (Cannot exceed +5 from D&D mods) modifier plus any Additions, Items, and Class features. (Reference Additions and Class info for further explanations.) <br><br>
                    For example if you have a 20 in WIS you would have a +5 WIS modifier. Transitively, you would have a 5 as your MTA AS. However, the homebrewed modifier calculations are slightly different. They are as follows:<br><br>
                    5 = +1<br><br>
                    10 = +2<br><br>
                    14 = +3<br><br>
                    17 = +4<br><br>
                    20 = +5<br><br>
                    The segments below the AS are your death saving throws. These are calculated the same way, the AS modifier is added to a d20 roll plus proficiency modifier if applicable.<br><br>

Homebrewed skills cannot gain proficiency unless it is gained from homebrewed classes unless specified otherwise. The skills relating to their use and related AS are as follows:

                    (Refer to the <a href="../combined.html" style="color: aqua;">Homebrewed Segment</a> for more resources related to choosing available augments and special rulings related to quantity and type)<br><br>
                    
                    The Augment segment of the sheet is focused less on utility and more on documentation; to the left of the segment, half of the area is allocated for notes relating to augment abilities and interactions. To the top right is a list of physical augmentation, containing 5 boxes to document the selection of a visor, 2 arms, a torso, and two legs. If the character is using Physical Cybernetics, the slots will need to be obtained, the squares to the sides of seach space are available to be marked on if conversions are obtained or other special circumstances are present. Space is allocated for notes or alterations provided by specific circumstances if applicable. <br><br>

                    Below the Physical Augments section is the Neurological Augments section, possessing a total of 7 slots. Once again refer to the link above for special rulings, however, it should be noted that generally only 4 neurological slots are available without special circumstances. Furthermore, two circles with an O and an A are present. These are for keeping track of your available augments slots. O for original, and A for altered. Fill in O if you only have access to the original 4 slots, and A for any other circumstances.<br><br>

                    Below is the Soul Augment sheet and Additions category. To the top Left is a segment for both Soul Casings and Radiant Forms, both of which are obtained through different means within the universe. The segment to the right taking up half of the section is the Soul Augment notes section. This section is for further information or additional Radiant Forms, as most radiant information will need to be stored externally or printed out on another sheet. <br><br>

                    As a general rule, characters may only have 1 Soul Case and 1 Radiant Form unless specified otherwise.<br><br>

                    Within the Additions Segment, is where all Additions are kept track of. Only 7 slots are present, however there is no limit to the amount you may have. Additions are stackable, and the boxes next to the lines are for keeping track of how many of the same additions are present with a character.<br><br>
