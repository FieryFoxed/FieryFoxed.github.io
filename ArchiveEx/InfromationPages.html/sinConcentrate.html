        <h2>Sin's Radiant Form</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                With sins' influence you can choose to take up radiant forms of the seven deadly sins. You can switch to them and out of them at will as an action. While in these forms, if an enemy exhibits the specific sin you have transformed into in mass, the enemy will become overwhelmed by their sin transforming into creatures of pure sin. <br><br><br><br>

Pride :<br><br>
While in prides radiant form, you gain a radiant aura, all creatures within 30 ft radius of you must succeed on a WIS 20 saving throw or be charmed by you. While charmed, the entity will complete small tasks for you at your request and will remain on good terms with you until you transform out of the radiant form. The tasks given cannot be too complex or inflict suffering on any party, moreover if the target leaves your radius the effects dissipate.<br><br>

Gift of song - As an action, you may grace an entity of your choice with a blessing. The entity will automatically succeed any persuasion roll that has a check of 19 or lower. This effect lasts until you determine otherwise or until you shift out of your radiant form.<br><br><br><br>


Greed :<br><br>
While in greed's radiant form, entities around you become infatuated with the trinkets and treasures you create. You will constantly be generating illusory treasure while in this form to do with what you please.<br><br>

Barter: With this illusory treasure, you may offer as a trade to any entity you wish as an action. If the entity is not already willing to trade, they must succeed on a INT 20 saving throw or be forced to take the deal you offer. Only one deal may take place at once, however once a deal has been formed, you may offer more treasure in exchange for more service from the creature at a reduced or null INT saving throw.<br><br><br><br>


Wrath : <br><br>
While in wrath’s radiant form, your animalistic rage pushes to the forefront of your mind, empowering your attacks. When attacking with melee attacks you may,<br><br>

Drive: push the creature back 10 ft provoking opportunity attacks from allies in the process, if the target is stopped by a wall or obstacle, target takes 2d10 force damage. When pushing the target, you may travel with them to the new location, however this does not provoke opportunity attacks.<br><br>

Flay: attacks have a chance to tear weak points in the target’s defenses, combo attacks with successful consecutive flat attacks will have increasing power. Roll a d20 on attack, if the roll is above a 10, flay is applied. The first flay does nothing, the second consecutive flay will give the next attack advantage, the third consecutive flay will make the target vulnerable to the next attack.<br><br>

Eviscerate: if the target is below 10% hp, instantly eliminate the target.<br><br><br><br>


Envy :<br><br>
While I’m the form of envy, all enemies will become enraged by your presence, dropping whatever predetermined task they may have had and charge you head on. Furthermore, while in this form you gain a plus 3 to AC.<br><br>

Radiant beauty: As a reaction you may dawn a protective shell, offering +10 to AC until the start of your next turn, however you forfeit your next action.<br><br><br><br>


Gluttony :<br><br>
While in the gluttony form, you become stationary unable to move until switching out of this form. However your HP is quadrupled, and any health that doesn’t go over this amount into your own will be healed when switching out of this form.<br><br>

Produce: As an action you may choose to produce food, tech, or impulse. An ally may pick up one of these items, healing 20+1d20 on picking up food, add 1 temp Ac on picking up tech, or grain a random buff on picking up impulse. These effects last until switching out of the form.<br><br><br><br>

Conquest :<br><br>
While In the form of conquest, your radiant aura offers companions within a radius of 30 ft advantage on attacks. Furthermore while in this radius they gain +5 to both hit and damage rolls.<br><br>

Radiant steed: As an action you may summon a fiery battle steed, riding it in a straight line up to 60 feet and summoning a path of fire under itself. This fire deals 10d4 along with 3d4 each turn a target remains in the fire afterwards. A target who is in the fire at any point takes 4d6 fire damage each turn until extinguished with sn action.<br><br><br><br>

Desire :<br><br>

While in desire’s radiant form, you have influence over the desires of an intended target. As an action you may roll a d6 and declare a target, the number on the die coinciding with another sin.<br><br>

1 = Pride<br>
2 = Greed<br>
3 = Wrath<br>
4 = Envy<br>
5 = Gluttony<br>
6 = Conquest <br><br>

When the intended target is affected by this roll, their new goal in life will become to devote themselves to the activity of this sin, however to what extent is determined by their previous level of inhibitions towards their previous goals. This effect remains until you switch out of the radiant form, however is permanent for any level of Sins Blessing.<br><br>

Obsession - As an action, you may inflict obsession onto an intended target. The target will leave behind any pretense of completing whatever it was they were doing, and relentlessly consume themselves in whatever sin they exhibit. This effect is wildly unpredictable and will last until switched out of the radiant form, however if Sins Blessing is utilized the effect is permanent.
